# Pokemon ML Project

A personal project of mine to learn about the different classical ML algorithms and its hyperparameter that we can tune. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle where each row is a Pokemon with various data such as its status (HP, Atk, Sp.Def, etc.), weaknesses, height, and more. 

The first goal is to predict a Pokemon's primary type using the data mentioned above. The 6 ML models that I'll be trying for this goal are:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. K-Nearest Neighbor
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes
6. Multi-Layer Perceptron
